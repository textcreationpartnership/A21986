            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Wherefore hauing taken order for the returning home into their Countreys of diuers of the Nobilitie of our Nation of Scotland, and others alſo, who to do vs honour at our Coronation, haue attended here ſince the entring of Vs and the Queene our deare wiſe into this Kingdome: We haue thought good alſo to publiſh to all other good Subiects of this Realme, that our Pleaſure is, and we command that all ſuch as are not our Seruants in Ordinary, or be not bound to attendance about our Court by expreſſe commandement of Vs, or our Councell, ſhall immediatly depart home into their Countreys; Specially all Deputy Lieutenants, and all ſuch as are in Commiſſion of the Peace, there to attend their ſeuerall charges, &amp; chiefly to preuent by all good meanes the ſpreading of this Contagion of the Plague. For ſeeing now there is no neceſſary cauſe why any man ſhould abide either about our Citie of London, or about our Court, who is not our ordinary Seruant, We ſhal haue iuſt cauſe to be offended with ſuch, as ſhall contrary to this our Pleaſure, voluntarily abſent themſelues from the places where their dueties doe require they ſhould abide.</p>
            <p>And whereas We are giuen to vnderſtand, That notwithſtanding our former Proclamation, there doe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hang vpon our Court, a great number of idle and maſterleſſe perſons, aſwell Scottiſſh as Engliſh, who can giue no accompt of their abode here: For preuenting hereof our Pleaſure is, That all Noblemen and Gentlemen our ordinary ſeruants or attendants in Court, ſhall preſently within three dayes after the publiſhing hereof, deliuer in to our Chamberlaine, to the Officers of our Greencloth, and to our Knight Marſhal, to each of them a Roll of the names of ſuch as be their ſeruants in ordinary, wherin We require them to haue care to receine no more then they muſt needs bee ſerued with: With which Roll Wee haue giuen charge, that the ſayd Knight Marſhall ſhall continually ride, both in the day time and in the night about our Court, and whomſoeuer they ſhall ſinde not centeined in the ſayde Roll, they ſhall puniſh according to the Lawes of our Realme, or otherwiſe as ſhall bee thought meete for ſuch contempts. And for that our pleaſure alſo is, during the time of this Infection, That our Court be not followed with vnneceſſary multitudes vnder pretence of Suites, We doe charge all Sutors to abſtaine from following of vs for this time, ſauing onely ſuch as haue Suits, or cauſe of attendance of our Councell for neceſſary ſeruices. For the diſcerning whereof, We haue appointed, that the Maſters of our Requeſts, or one of them, with one of the Clearkes of our Councell, or of our Signet, ſhal reſide at Kingſton till Wedneſday next, of purpoſe to receiue the Petitions of all ſuch as ſuppoſe they haue any neceſſary cauſe to attend for the ſeruice at the Court, and ſhall allowe ſuch as they ſhall ſee cauſe why for our ſeruice they ſhould be purſued, and all others deferre till the Winter: And after that day paſſed no Suitor ſhall be allowed to follow the Court, vpon what pretence ſoeuer, during this Contagion.</p>
